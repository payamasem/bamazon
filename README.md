# Bamazon Node App!
Bamazon is a node/mysql app that works as an inventory database. Customers can purchase products through this application and see what items are in stock. We will soon be adding a manager and executive login as well! Below is a live demo of the client (customer) side.


### LIVE DEMO:
First, the individual inputs the item ID, and then they will be prompted to enter a quantity. Once they select the item and quantity, the app will return them their purchase total, and update the sql database with the new stock quantity based on how many items they purchased.

When the quantity requested exceeds the quantity available, the application will prompt the user that the item is out of stock.
